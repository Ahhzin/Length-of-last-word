# To calculate Halstead length and volume measures for a given program, we need to identify the following components based on Halstead's software metrics:

n1: Number of distinct operators
n2: Number of distinct operands
N1: Total occurrences of operators
N2: Total occurrences of operands

Distinct Operators (n1):
def
=
# (comment, not typically counted)
.
if
not
return
len
[] (indexing operator)
() (function call operator)
print
There are 10 distinct operators.

Distinct Operands (n2):
length_of_last_word (function name)
s (parameter)
words (variable)
split (method)
0
[-1] (index value)
"hello everyone" (string)
"testing code" (string)
"running code" (string)
There are 9 distinct operands.

## Total Occurrences of Operators (N1):
def (1)
= (1)
. (1)
if (1)
not (1)
return (2)
len (1)
[] (1)
() (5, counting function calls and method call)
print (3)
## Total occurrences of operators: 17

## Total Occurrences of Operands (N2):
length_of_last_word (4, including function definition and calls)
s (2)
words (3)
split (1)
0 (1)
[-1] (1)
"hello everyone" (1)
"testing code" (1)
"running code" (1)
Total occurrences of operands: 15

## Halstead Metrics Calculations
1. Program Length(N)
          N = N1+ N2 =17+15 =32
2.Program Vocabulary(n)
          n=n1+n2=10+9=19
3.volume(V)
          V= N * log2(n)= 32*log2(19)
              log2(19) =4.2479
           V = 32*4.2479 =135.9328

## Summary
Halstead Length (N): 32
Halstead Volume (V): 135.9328
These values provide an understanding of the program's size and complexity based on Halstead's software metrics.​
